/// Grouping, top-to-bottom:
///   1. Offline-disk-access family (cold disk theft, keyring file

/// *Threats deliberately not listed:* same-user malware (a hostile
/// process running as the same OS user holds every grant the app
/// has) and live process memory dump (ptrace / debugger attached to
/// the running app) are ✗ on every tier — no config we ship defends

/// *Why keyring file exfiltration splits T1 from T2 without password:*

/// `login.keychain-db`) — a powered-off disk attacker can read the
/// file and recover the key offline. T2 stores the wrapped blob on
/// disk but the unwrap key lives inside the TPM / Secure Enclave /
/// StrongBox; exporting it is refused by the hardware regardless of
/// whether an auth value is set. The on-disk blob is useless without
/// the physical chip. This is the structural advantage T2 keeps over
/// T1 even when neither has a password.
///
/// *Why offline brute force is symmetric across T1 and T2:* the
/// threat as formulated is "the attacker has an on-disk blob and
/// tries passwords against it offline". Without a user password on
/// either tier the attack does not apply — but the same attacker
/// still wins via a different path (keyring file exfil on T1, the
/// hardware module refuses everything on T2). The honest rendering
/// is a symmetric ✗ on both T1-no-pw and T2-no-pw; the
/// keyring-file-theft row above carries the real T1-vs-T2 split that
/// makes T2-no-pw actually more protected than T1-no-pw. Earlier
/// versions of this table showed T2-no-pw ✓ here on the logic of
/// "no on-disk brute-force target" — clever but confusing: users read
/// the password modifier as the only way ✓ appears on the brute-force
/// row, and the lopsided ✓ broke that mental model.
///
/// Pure function — no I/O, no locale lookups, no platform probes.
/// Every UI surface consumes this map and renders ✓ / ✗ per threat.
