//! FRB adapter for `lfs_core::path`. Tilde-prefix expansion as a
//! synchronous one-shot — Dart hands in a `~` / `~/...` path,
//! Rust resolves against `$HOME` / `$USERPROFILE` and returns the
//! expanded string.
//!
//! **Mobile semantics intentionally differ.** Dart's
//! `homeDirectory` getter prefers `EXTERNAL_STORAGE` on Android
//! (shared storage `/storage/emulated/0`) over `$HOME` (the app's
//! private data dir). The Rust helper has no equivalent
//! Android-specific fallback — it follows the desktop / iOS
//! resolution order strictly. Today's only call site (Dart
//! `OpenSshConfigImporter.expandHome`) keeps using the Dart
//! getter so import-on-Android behaviour stays unchanged; the
//! Rust helper is here for future Rust-side callers (a Rust
//! port of the OpenSSH parser, the macOS resign orchestrator)
//! that have no Android consumer.

/// Expand a leading `~` against the running process's home
/// directory. See [`lfs_core::path::expand_tilde`] for the
