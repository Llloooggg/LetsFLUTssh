## Conventions

### Architecture (non-obvious rules)
- **No SCP** — dartssh2 doesn't support it; SFTP covers all use cases
- SSH keys accepted **both as file and text** (paste PEM)
- `.lfs` export format and import modes — single source of truth: [§3.9 Import](ARCHITECTURE.md#39-import-coreimport)
- Credentials in `CredentialStore` (AES-256-GCM), NOT in plain JSON — [§3.6 Security](ARCHITECTURE.md#36-security--encryption-coresecurity)
- **State placement** — app-wide state → Riverpod `NotifierProvider`; widget-local state (dialog / pane / panel / tab) with constructor-injected args or caches → `ChangeNotifier` + `AnimatedBuilder` (canonical examples: `FilePaneController`, `UnifiedExportController`, `SessionPanelController`, `TransferPanelController`). Side-channel Riverpod overrides for widget-local state = boilerplate with no win — [§4.3 Widget-local controllers](ARCHITECTURE.md#43-widget-local-controllers-changenotifier)

### Theme & UI Constants
OneDark theme: centralized in `app_theme.dart`, semantic color constants, no hardcoded `Colors` — [§8 Theme](ARCHITECTURE.md#8-theme-system)

- **Font sizes** — never hardcode `fontSize`. Use `AppFonts.tiny`/`xxs`/`xs`/`sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl` (mobile +2 px)
- **Border radius** — never hardcode `BorderRadius.circular(N)`. Use `AppTheme.radiusSm` (4), `radiusMd` (6), `radiusLg` (8). Exception: pill-shaped elements
- **Heights** — never hardcode height literals. Use `AppTheme` constants: `barHeight{Sm,Md,Lg}`, `controlHeight{Xs..Xl}`, `itemHeight{Xs..Xl}`

### UI Components
- **Buttons & hover** — `AppIconButton` for all icon buttons. `HoverRegion` for custom hover containers. Never use bare `IconButton`, `InkWell` for buttons, or manual `MouseRegion`+`GestureDetector`+`setState(_hovered)`. Exception: `context_menu.dart`, mobile touch buttons — [§6 Widgets API](ARCHITECTURE.md#6-widgets--public-api-reference)
- **Dialogs** — `AppDialog` for all modal dialogs. Never use bare `AlertDialog`. Complex dialogs: compose from `AppDialogHeader`/`AppDialogFooter`/`AppDialogAction`. Progress: `AppProgressDialog.show()`. Exception: mobile touch buttons keep `Material`+`InkWell` for ripple
- **Text overflow protection** — localized text in `Row` or fixed-width — wrap with `Flexible`/`Expanded` + `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`. For label columns use `ConstrainedBox(maxWidth:)` instead of fixed `SizedBox(width:)`
- **Accessibility** — wrap interactive list items (session rows, file rows) and panel headers with `Semantics` widget. Use `label` for screen reader text, `button: true` for tappable items, `selected` for selection state, `header: true` for section headings. `StatusIndicator` includes built-in `Semantics`
- **Disable vs hide unavailable controls — depends on surface type.** On *configuration surfaces* (Settings, session-edit forms, preference dialogs), always render the control as **disabled with a tooltip + tap-toast explaining the reason** — never hide it. The user is exploring what the app can do and needs to know the option exists (cross-device install, missing hardware, missing prerequisite). On *action surfaces* (lock screen, context menus, per-row action buttons, action dialogs), **hide** unavailable actions — the user is trying to do a specific task and a greyed button is noise, not information. Disabled state must visibly affect the whole row (opacity on the full container), not just the trailing knob
- **Prefer shared components over one-off widgets.** Project is moving toward reuse — before adding a new widget/helper/style, search `lib/widgets/` and `lib/core/**` for an existing component. If behaviour is close but not identical, extend the shared component (add a param) rather than duplicating. Hardcoded column widths, button styles, padding scales, tile layouts, dialog shapes, form rows — all live in shared modules. Only introduce a local one-off when the shared pattern genuinely doesn't fit; then document why. Canonical examples: `AppIconButton`, `AppDialog`, `HoverRegion`, `AppTheme.radius*`, `AppFonts.*`, `AppTheme.*ColWidth` constants

### Localization (i18n)
All user-facing strings MUST use `S.of(context).xxx`. Never hardcode strings in widgets — treat this as a bug. Add keys to `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`, run `flutter gen-l10n`, use `S.of(context).newKey`. Exceptions: constructor defaults (no context), log messages, `_AlreadyRunningApp`. Tests must include `localizationsDelegates: S.localizationsDelegates, supportedLocales: S.supportedLocales` in every `MaterialApp`. See [§8.1 i18n](ARCHITECTURE.md#81-internationalization-i18n)

## Code Quality — SonarCloud

All code must follow **Effective Dart** and pass `dart analyze` with zero issues. `make analyze` must pass before every commit. **Never suppress** — `// ignore:`, `// NOSONAR`, `@SuppressWarnings` are forbidden, always fix the root cause.

### Rules that bite most often

Write code that already obeys these on first draft — don't write it, wait for the scanner to complain, and then refactor.

- **S3776 — cognitive complexity ≤ 15.** Each `if` / `for` / `while` / `switch case` / `&&` / `||` adds to the score, and nesting multiplies. A single widget `build()` with a tall `children: [ if … else ... if … for (…) widget(a ? b : c) ]` blows the budget fast. When in doubt:
  - Extract each conditional child into a `Widget _buildFoo(…)` helper (empty state, header row, list, footer → one helper each).
  - Pull repeated inline computations (`X ? s.foo : null`, `X ? fgDim : null`) into a local `final already = …;` before the `return DataCheckboxRow(…)`.
  - Any `for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) ComplexWidget(a: list[i].x, b: … ? … : …, c: … ? … : null)` → extract a `_buildRow(i)` helper.
  - **Non-widget patterns that still trip S3776** (learned the hard way, don't repeat):
    - **Top-level `if (enable) { … } else { … }` with non-trivial branches** → split the method on the boolean, e.g. `_toggleFoo(enable)` delegates to `_enableFoo()` / `_disableFoo()`. Each branch gets its own cognitive budget.
    - **Long `if (error is X) return …;` chains in a single function** → group by category and extract `_tryLocalizeFooError` helpers that return `String?`; the top-level function becomes a flat "try category → fall through" sequence.
    - **Async methods that chain 3+ phases with nested mounted / null guards** (e.g. pick file → ask password → decrypt → preview → apply) → extract each phase into a `Future<T?> _phaseFoo(…)` helper that returns `null` on cancel/failure; the caller becomes a straight-line pipeline of `await … ; if (x == null) return;` steps.
    - **Optional archive / JSON entries with nested `if (requested) { if (present) { if (valid) { … } } }`** → extract an `_entryReader` that returns `T?` and does the size/validity check at its own scope. Caller becomes `final x = requested ? _readFoo(archive) : null;`.
- **S3358 — no nested ternaries.** Patterns like `busy ? null : (forKeys ? _a : _b)` or `value == true ? doX() : value == false ? doY() : doZ()` must be rewritten as `if` / `else if` / `else` assigning to a local, or a `switch` expression. A single non-nested ternary is fine. **Also watch for the subtle case** where an outer ternary's branch is a widget constructor whose argument is itself a ternary — `active ? Icon(asc ? up : down) : null` is already S3358. Extract the whole trailing widget into a `_directionIcon(col)` helper that short-circuits on the inactive case.
- **S1854 — dead / unused values.** Don't `final x = ...;` then overwrite `x` unconditionally before use. In Dart `late final x; if (…) x = …; else x = …;` or an `if`/`else`-assigned local is the idiomatic fix.
- **S1192 — string literals duplicated ≥ 3 times.** Pull them into a `static const _kFoo = '…'` or an existing localization key.
- **S1481 — unused local vars / S1172 — unused parameters.** Either delete or prefix with `_`. Don't leave them around "just in case".
- **No `print()` / `debugPrint()`** — use `AppLogger.instance.log(message, name: 'Tag')`. **Never log sensitive data** (keys, passwords, raw PEM). Errors surfacing to the UI go through `localizeError()` so PEM / base64 are redacted.
- **No generated file edits** — `*.g.dart` and `*.freezed.dart` are excluded from analysis; change the source instead.

### Shape before scanner

If a method's body is more than ~30 lines or has three nested conditional blocks, split it up before committing. Widget `build()` methods over that threshold should already have named `_buildFoo` helpers for each section.

## Testing Methodology

Target: 100% coverage (excluding integration tests and tests on the actual platform). One test file per source file. Testable by design: extract pure logic from SSH/platform/I/O deps, DI over hardcoded `ref.read()` — [§14 Testing Patterns](ARCHITECTURE.md#14-testing-patterns--di-hooks).

- **Tests assert spec, not current output.** Before writing any `expect(...)`, state in one sentence what the function _should_ do for that input — derived from the feature's intent, not from running the code and copying the result. **Never** run the function, observe the output, and paste it into `expect(...)` as the oracle — that's a pinning test and it cements bugs instead of catching them. This applies doubly to parsers, formatters, `localizeError`, and anything touching untrusted input. If the correct behavior is genuinely unclear, stop and ask the user rather than inventing an oracle.
- **When test and code disagree, surface it — don't silently "fix" either side.** If your derived spec says X and the code returns Y, you have one of three situations: (1) real bug in code, (2) wrong spec on your side, (3) ambiguous requirement. You cannot tell which from inside the test file. Stop, report the disagreement to the user with: the input, the spec you derived + where you derived it from (commit, docstring, user-facing string, issue), and the current output. Let the user decide which side is wrong. Only after confirmation: fix code **or** update the spec. A confident "I found a bug, fixing it" on an edge case is exactly how correct behavior gets quietly regressed.
- **Uncovered lines are a marker, not a target.** An uncovered line means "no test verifies the behavior this line implements" — it does NOT mean "write anything that touches this line". Do not write tests whose only goal is to execute the line (calling the function with arbitrary input and `expect(result, isNotNull)` / `isA<T>()` / "doesn't throw"). Ask first: what branch, decision, or contract does this line encode? Write a test that fails if that contract breaks. If you cannot articulate the contract, the line either needs refactoring (the logic is too implicit to test) or a user conversation (you don't understand it yet) — not a coverage-hit wrapper.
- **Fuzz tests for parsers** — any function that parses untrusted input (JSON `fromJson()`, URI parsing, file format parsing) must have a corresponding fuzz test in `test/fuzz/`. Fuzz tests generate random/malformed inputs and verify the parser never crashes with unhandled exceptions. Run as part of `make test`. See [§14 Fuzz testing](ARCHITECTURE.md#fuzz-testing).
- **UI changes = test updates** — proactively update all tests that reference changed widget names, labels, or finders.

## Commits & Versioning

- **Claude does not commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.** "commit" = commit only, "commit and push" = commit + push.
- **HARD STOP between fixes** — implement fix → write tests → update docs → **stop and ask user to commit**. Do NOT start the next fix until the current one is committed. **Exception:** when the user explicitly asks to fix everything at once ("fix all and push"), execute end-to-end without pausing between fixes.
- Format per [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages). Messages drive auto-changelog — keep them user-readable.
- **Use `type(scope):` with parenthesized scope** for commits that touch a specific module (e.g. `refactor(import): ...`, `test(known-hosts): ...`, `feat(installer): ...`). Drop the scope only when the change is genuinely cross-cutting and no single module name fits. Scope must be lowercase, alphanumeric + dashes.
- **Version bumps are automatic.** The `/pr` skill runs `scripts/bump-version.sh` before creating PR — it parses conventional commits since the last tag and bumps `pubspec.yaml` (patch for fix/refactor/perf/build/deps, minor for feat, major for BREAKING CHANGE; chore/docs/test/ci/Revert = no bump). **Do NOT bump version manually** — just use correct conventional commit prefixes. Dependabot PRs are bumped by CI (`dependabot-auto.yml`).
- **Never amend after push** — only new commits. Amend OK only before first push.
- **Green CI before merging to main** — pre-commit hook runs `make check` automatically.

## Branching & Release Flow

- **Claude default branch is `dev`.** Always work on `dev` unless explicitly told otherwise. Never push directly to `main`.
- Repository is **public** on GitHub.

| Scenario                    | What to do                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App change (feat/fix/refac) | `bump-version.sh` on dev → PR `dev` → `main` → CI → auto-tag → release |
| Tests/docs/CI only          | Merge to `main` — no bump, no tag, no release                      |
| Dependabot deps             | Auto: PR to main → bump in branch → merge → CI → auto-tag → release |
| Manual build                | `gh workflow run build-release.yml` — fails if CI hasn't passed     |
| Failed build (re-trigger)   | `gh workflow run build-release.yml --ref v{VERSION}`                |
